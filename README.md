## 📊 Project Overview

You know what they say: "Every row tells a story."  
In this case, over **1,000 transactions** across demographics, categories, and seasons helped uncover:

- Who’s buying what (and when)
- What sells best (and worst)
- Where discounts and promos fall flat
- Why your summer stock might need a second look

---

## 💼 Business Analysis

We analyzed variables such as:

- 👥 **Age + Gender**
- 🛒 **Items Purchased + Category**
- 💳 **Payment Preferences**
- 🎯 **Previous Purchases + Frequency**
- 📦 **Shipping & Discounts**
- ⭐ **Customer Reviews**

## 🕳️ Loopholes & Pitfalls

Here’s where the business is *leaking style AND sales*:

1. **High Review Ratings ≠ High Revenue**
   - Some highly-rated products aren't your top sellers.
   - Great feedback, low push — sounds like a marketing miss.

2. **Loyal Customers, No Perks?**
   - Many repeat buyers have no subscription or discount benefit.
   - Retention strategy? Weak. Time to fix that.

3. **Summer Overload**
   - Majority of sales happen in Summer, with other seasons trailing.
   - Your inventory calendar needs balancing — Winter needs love too ❄️

4. **Promo Code? What Promo Code?**
   - Almost nobody uses promo codes.
   - Are they invisible or just ineffective?

## 🚀 Strategic Growth Tips

💡 **1. Introduce Loyalty Discounts**  
Reward repeat purchases with tiered incentives or limited-time perks.

📦 **2. Push for Seasonal Diversity**  
Launch seasonal campaigns for Fall & Winter wear to smooth out yearly sales volatility.

🧼 **3. Refresh the Promo Strategy**  
Make codes easier to access, visually stand out at checkout, or tie them to review submissions.

📍 **4. Targeted Location-Based Ads**  
Montana, Idaho, and others show higher sales — push geo-personalized ads there.

🎯 **5. Subscription Club? Oh yes.**  
Introduce a "VIP Style Club" with exclusive drops, early access, or free shipping.
